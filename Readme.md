Warehouse app with multiple functionalities!

A few steps to set and start the project:

## 1.Before npm install

npm cache clean --force (don't worry about --force command, sometimes the things should be slapped :D)

## 2.Npm install

npm install to install all dependencies

## 2.1 Any errors related to npm installation

If you hit any issues based on npm errors, just delete (node_modules) and install them one by one with the related versions,
you can check them in package.json

## 3.Useful links:
